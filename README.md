## Requirements
### Installation
Create a conda environment and install dependencies:
```shell
conda create -n sama python=3.10.11
conda activate sama

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset
#### 1. Download the datasets 
- AVSBench
    - Please refer to [https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/AVSBench](https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/AVSBench) to download the AVSBench dataset.
    - Please download re-organized split files with the [OneDrive link](https://sjtueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jinxliu_sjtu_edu_cn/Er7zTMpltupFjmbvaVYMKzQBeEhmJSzvv3hpSqPyNAQOPg?e=7vrIHc) which might be helpful.
- AVS-Synthetic
    - Please download the dataset from [https://zenodo.org/record/8125822](https://zenodo.org/record/8125822).

#### 2. Configure the dataset locations
After downloading the datasets with annotations, please declare the directory and file locations in the `configs/sam_avs_adapter.yaml` file.

## Get Started
### Evaluation
**Model weights**: All the weights including the image backbone from SAM, audio backbone for VGGish and our pretrained models are obtained with the [OneDrive link](https://sjtueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jinxliu_sjtu_edu_cn/Ejm_Lp4ZctZBnnrExc52-uYBqYwN8Y6CsE21Nc8GFQRVNA?e=t4Chgc).
- Please place `vggish-10086976.pth` and `sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth` in `assets` sub-folder.
- Please place the pretrained model weights in `ckpts` sub-folder.

#### Test
- Test on AVS-Synthetic test set
```shell
bash scripts/synthetic_test.sh
```

- Test on AVSBench S4 test set
```shell
bash scripts/s4_test.sh
```



- Test on AVSBench MS3 test set
```shell
bash scripts/ms3_test.sh
```



### Training
- Train AVS-Synthetic
```shell
bash scripts/synthetic_train.sh
```
- Train AVSBench S4
```shell
bash scripts/s4_train.sh
```

- Train AVSBench MS3
```shell
bash scripts/ms3_train.sh
